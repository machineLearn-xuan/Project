## Concept 1 
### Demand Forecasting for Rail Services 
•	Objective: Develop a ML model to forecast demand for train services in different boroughs, helping to allocate trains dynamically; more trains during rush hour, less trains during non-peak hours.

•	Data: Historical ridership data, population growth projections, economic activity data. 

•	Approach: Use time-series forecasting models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM?) to predict demand based on historical trends. Ensuring that rail services are scaled dynamically to meet fluid demand, improving system efficiency and reducing station / train carriage overcrowding.

## Concept 1 
### Terrain Classification for Rail Route Planning 
•	Objective: Use ML to classify terrain types (e.g., flat, mountainous, coastal) to assist in rail route planning. 

•	Data: Satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), soil type data. 

•	Approach: Apply image classification models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks?) to classify terrain types based on satellite imagery and their associated colours and tones and with elevation data. Thereby, identifying the most suitable routes for rail lines to be constructed, avoiding challenging terrain that would increase construction costs.
